This project, titled CYBER SHIELD, presents a comprehensive approach to cyberbullying detection using machine learning techniques. The system performs natural language processing (NLP) on tweet data to clean, preprocess, and vectorize user-generated content. Using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) as an existing baseline model and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) as the proposed enhancement, the model classifies tweets into various types of cyberbullying such as religion-based, age-based, and ethnicity-based abuse. The model is trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
